| The process of verifying a user's or an entity's identity                                                           | The process of authorizing or refusing access to particular resources or functions within an application                                              |
| This include validating the user's credentials, such as username and password when user logins to a web application | Once a user has been verified as authentic, the program checks their level of authorization to decide which areas of the application they can access. |

# 2 - NoSQL Injection
---
- NoSQL **injection** is an attack that specifically targets NoSQL databases, including MongoDB.
- It takes advantage of poorly sanitized user input. 
	- The user input is directly used in database queries without proper validation. This allows attackers to manipulate queries and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.

By injecting malicious code, attackers can 
- exploit the vulnerability to alter query logic
- gain unauthorized access to sensitive data
- corrupt the entire database

# 3 - Best practices
---
- Input validation and Sanitization
	- *How are they perform? They look sames*
	- Input Validation 
		- Ensures data entered by users meets specific criteria, such as format, length and type
		- It can be done using Joi or validator..js
		- https://joi.dev/ or https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator
	- Input Sanitization 
		- Removes potentially harmful characters or code to prevent injection attacks or other security vulnerabilities.
		- It can be done using functions like escapeHTML or sanitize-html to remove potentially dangerous characters or scripts.
		- https://github.com/component/escape-html or https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-html
	- Implements parameterized queries in database operations to ***prevent SQL injection*** attacks by separating SQL code from user input
	- Leverages ODM/ORM which provides an abstraction layer that handle input sanitization, query construction, and data scheme validation.
	- Performs Regex validation for email addresses, passwords or other sensitive data ensures that only ***valid input*** is accepted. (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions)
- Authentication and Authorization
	- Authentication verifies users' identity for whom attempts to access the application
		- JSON Web Token (JWT) or ***OAuth*** provide a robust framework for user authentication.
		-  https://jwt.io/ or https://oauth.net/
		- Implements ***multi-factor authentication (MFA)*** for more security by requiring users to verify their identify using multiple factors.
		- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multi-factor-authentication-using-mern/ or https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/account-security-quickstart-node
		- 
	- Authorization determines the actions allowed for users to perform based on their roles and permissions.

| Password hashing                 | Uses strong cryptographic algorithm to ensure passwords are securely stored in the database.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Token-based authentication       | Enables stateless communication between the client and the server, reducing risk of ***session hijacking***.                                                                                                                                                                            |
 
- Secure configuration
	- Setting up the application environment and infrastructure in a way that minimizes security risks and vulnerabilities.

Enforcing HTTPS encryption for all communication between the client and server protects data from ***eavesdropping and tampering***

Proper CORS configuration restricts cross-origin requests to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

Securing sensitive configuration files and credentials, such as database connection strings or API keys, protects them from unauthorized access or exposure

Restricting access to administrative interfaces and debug endpoints minimizes the risk of unauthorized access or exploitation

Utilizing security headers like ***X-Content-Type Options*** and ***X-Frame-Option***s adds an extra layer of protection against common web vulnerabilities like ***MIME-type sniffing and clickjacking***

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options

- Session Management
- maintaining user sessions securely to prevent unauthorized access, session fixation, or session hijacking attacks
- Storing session data securely, preferably using server side storage mechanisms like databases or server memory, ensures that sensitive session information is not exposed to client-side attacks
- Setting appropriate session timeout periods, based on the application’s security requirements and user behavior, minimizes the risk of session hijacking or unauthorized access due to idle sessions.
- Regenerating session identifiers after successful authentication or privilege escalation prevents session fixation attacks and enhances session security.
- Implementing secure cookie attributes like HttpOnly and Secure ensures that session cookies are only accessible via HTTP and HTTPS connections, respectively, reducing the risk of cookie theft or session hijacking https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies
- Encrypting session data using strong encryption algorithms protects sensitive session information from unauthorized access or tampering, even if the session data is intercepted in transit or stored in a compromised location

- Keeping Dependencies Updated
	- Regularly updating dependencies important for mitigating security vulnerabilities, and ensuring the overall stability of the application
	- Outdated dependencies may contain known security flaws that could be exploited by attackers
	- Automating dependency updates using tools like npm audit and Renovate saves time and ensures that dependencies are promptly updated whenever new versions or security patches are released https://docs.npmjs.com/auditing-package-dependencies-for-security-vulnerabilities or https://docs.renovatebot.com/
	- Regularly reviewing dependency vulnerabilities and applying patches promptly helps mitigate potential security risks and keeps the application secure
	- Utilizing package-lock.json or yarn.lock files to lock dependencies ensures that the same versions of dependencies are installed across different environments, reducing the risk of compatibility issues or unintentional dependency upgrades
	- Monitoring release notes and security advisories for installed packages provides insights into security updates and vulnerabilities, allowing developers to prioritize and address critical issues promptly
	- Conducting periodic security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities proactively help maintain a robust security posture and ensures that the application is protected against emerging threats




- Implementing Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security standard that helps mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by defining and enforcing a policy that controls which resources a web page is allowed to load 

 https://content-security-policy.com/
 https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/
 https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP

CSP prevents the execution of malicious scripts injected into web pages by attackers

 Defining a strict CSP policy with directives like default-src and script-src specifies the trusted sources from which content, scripts, and other resources can be loaded, reducing the risk of XSS attacks

https://content-security-policy.com/script-src/

Implementing nonce-based CSP allows inline scripts to be executed securely by generating a unique nonce for each script tag and including the corresponding nonce value in the CSP header
https://content-security-policy.com/nonce/

Enabling CSP reporting allows the collection of violation reports when a policy directive is violated, providing insights into potential security threats and helping fine-tune the CSP policy
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP#enabling_reporting

Utilizing CSP meta tags or HTTP headers to apply the CSP policy ensures that the policy is enforced consistently across all pages of the web application
https://content-security-policy.com/examples/meta/

Regularly reviewing and updating CSP directives to accommodate changes in application requirements or dependencies Ensure that the CSP policy remains effective against evolving security threats and attack vectors


# 4 - Developer-side Error Handling
---
Error handling The process of responding to and managing errors in software applications to maintain functionality

**Importance of Error Handling**
Paramount for preventing crashes and providing clear, user-friendly messages that reduce user frustration and encourage feedback
Effective error handling involves creating meaningful error messages and utilizing HTTP status codes like 200, 400, and 500 to accurately convey the nature of the problem
Help in identifying issues early, allowing for quick resolution and maintaining system reliability

Primarily three types of error handling:

 synchronous error handling using try-catch
 asynchronous error handling with callbacks
 promise-based error handling using .catch() for promises or async/await with try-catch

Logging is the backbone of diagnosing issues within your application 
Comprehensive logging strategies, including the use of tools like Winston or Bunyan, enable the storage of logs centrally with rotation strategies

Ensuring that critical errors or performance issues are monitored closely

Implementing alerts for these errors with services like Sentry or New Relic can significantly optimize performance and enhance the debugging process

MongoDB, while not susceptible to noSQL injection-type attacks, can still be altered to achieve malicious results.
Express.js is vulnerable to various injection and cross-site attacks

Securing these components through practices like encryption, sanitizing user input, and updating dependencies regularly is crucial for minimizing security risks

Incorporating these error handling and logging strategies into MERN stack development process:
safeguard your applications
provide a robust foundation for building reliable and
user-friendly web applications

Best Practices for Error Handling in MERN Applications

1. Centralized Error Handling with Express.js
2. Creating User-Friendly Error Messages
3. Utilizing HTTP Status Codes Correctly

Reference: https://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html

**Centralize Your Error Handling**
Centralizing error handling simplifies maintenance and enhances stability
Implement a global error handler middleware that catches errors during the request-response cycle
Added after all other middleware and route handlers to ensure it captures all unhandled errors
https://medium.com/@mohsinogen/simplified-guide-to-setting-up-a-global-error-handler-in-express-js-daf8dd640b69

Use Middleware for Async Errors
- Wrap asynchronous route handlers with middleware that catches errors and passes them to the next middleware
- Ensure that errors in asynchronous operations are not missed and are handled uniformly

Create Custom Error Classes
- Define custom error classes for different types of errors in your application
- Allow us to throw specific errors and catch them at a global level, making your error responses more predictable and easier to manage

**Creating User-Friendly Error Messages**
Meaningful Error Messages
- Ensure that the error messages you create are meaningful and user-friendly
- Avoid technical jargon that can confuse users 
- Provide clear, concise, and helpful information that can guide users on what went wrong and possibly how to fix it
Highlight Required Fields
- For form validations, such as in a workout application, highlight the fields that are required but left empty 
- Use conditional styling in your front-end code to make these fields stand out, guiding users to correct their inputs effectively
Custom Error Handling
- Develop a custom ErrorHandler class that extends the native Error class
- Allows us to throw specific exceptions like BadRequest or AuthExceptions, and handle these consistently across your application

Utilizing HTTP Status Codes Correctly
Appropriate HTTP Status Codes
- Use HTTP status codes effectively to communicate the
- nature of the error to the client
- Common codes include 200 for success, 400 for client errors, and 500 for server errors 
- Ensure that these codes are used correctly to make the error nature clear to the client
Avoid Sensitive Data Exposure
- When sending error messages, be careful not to expose sensitive data 
- Tailor your error messages to be helpful without compromising security
Error Handling in Middleware
- Define error-handling middleware functions in Express.js with four parameters (err, req, res, next)
- This setup helps in managing errors that occur during the request-handling pipeline efficiently


Client-side error Handling in

React Applications

1. Graceful Error Management in User Interfaces
2. Integrating Error Handling with React Context API
3. Improving User Experience with Clearly Communicated Errors

1. Graceful Error Management in User Interfaces
 React offers robust solutions for error management
 Utilizing Error Boundaries, React allows you to gracefully handle errors that might otherwise disrupt the user experience
 These boundaries act as a safety net, catching JavaScript errors in the component tree and preventing them from propagating
 By implementing Error Boundaries, you ensure that even if a component fails, the entire application remains stable
 https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#displaying-an-error-to-users-with-error-boundary


2. Integrating Error Handling with React Context API
Context API can centralize error handling, making it easier to manage and reducing the need for repetitive code
