# Guidance

1. **Treat presentation carefully.**

    Your lecturer and demonstrator will evaluate your work primarily based on your presentation, which carries a significant portion of the marks.

2. **Practice yourself.**

    Practice yourself to deliver an effective speech. The tune, the eye contact, the body language and so on.

3. **Practice with your team.**

    Team cooperation is crucial. Practice together to ensure a smooth and successful presentation. Assigning roles such as demonstrating and explaining, and determining the required items.

4. **Use slide.**

    Text is powerful, but nonetheless, graphics, videos, and audios have even greater impact. Utilize slides with minimal text and prioritize demonstrations will be the best way of presenting it.

5. **Write a script.**

    Prepare a script helps you to gain clarity on your speech. Besides, it enables better time management, allowing you to omit less important parts if necessary.

6. **Test run at least 3 times.**

    Conduct test runs to identify and address any potential issues. Without them, you won't realize how poorly you might perform.
