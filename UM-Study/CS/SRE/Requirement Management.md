What should be contained in a requirement traceability matrix?
The first would be the requirement ID, written in the form like F-001-V1.0. The ID not only uniquely identify each requirement, simplify communication, and it allows for version controls.

Besides, we should know the "source", or who suggest the requirement or who asks for the changes in requirements. We need to know the source so whenever we have question or problem to ask, we are able to seek for further clarification or negotiation.

**What is Requirement Configuration?**

**What is the tradeoff between using spreadsheet and Requirements Management System for traceability?**

**Why might items be requested for changes?**

**What is the purpose of PRE-RS (Pre-Requirement) Traceability?**
Pre-RS traceability aims to to demonstrate the reaching of vision and needs.

**What is the purpose of POST-RS (Pre-Requirement) Traceability?**
Post-RS traceability aims to evaluate results of changes.

**What is a Ridiculous Requirement?**
- The requirement that would be difficult to deliver given the state of technology at the time they are proposed.
- The requirement that, though possible to realize, is unlikely to be used.

**What is a Obsolete Requirement?**
- The requirement that has changed significantly during the system development
- The requirement that is no longer applied to the new system.

**How to decide between using a spreadsheet or a requirements management system for traceability?**
- If a relatively small number of requirements need to be managed (up to 250), traceability tables can be implemented using a spreadsheet.
- Hundreds or thousands of requirements require a Requirements Management System for traceability.

**What needs to be versioned?**
- Each SRS (Software Requirements Specification) and each requirement.

**What are the properties of Requirement Configuration?**
- Logical connection to meet the goal of the configuration.
- Consistency: The requirements within the configuration must not conflict with one another. For example, a conflicting requirement might be:
  - The Human Resources stakeholder group explicitly requests capturing the age of an employee.
  - The Data Privacy team states that the age of the employee may not be captured or used in reporting.
- Unique identification.
- Ability to rollback to earlier versions without errors.

**Why do requirements change?**
- Requirements errors, conflicts, and inconsistencies.
- Evolving stakeholder knowledge of the system as they develop a better understanding of what is required.
- Technical, schedule, or cost problems.
- Changing customer priorities (e.g., new competitor, change of staff, change of business vision).
- Changes in the environment where the system is installed.
- Organizational changes (structure or operational processes).

**What elements are required by the Change Control Board (CCB)?**
- Estimated cost of change.
- CCB decision status.
- CCB priority.
- Assignment of a person responsible for implementing the change.
- Re-planning system release.

**Why do we need a CCB?**
- The CCB checks for validity. Customers can misunderstand requirements and suggest unnecessary changes.
- Trace information to find dependent requirements affected by the change.
- Approve/Reject/Suggest requirement alternatives.
- If approved or suggesting an alternative: Estimate costs of making the changes.
- Discuss with the change requester.
