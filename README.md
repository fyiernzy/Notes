# Introduction

Inspired by [CS自学指南](https://csdiy.wiki/), I want to create a version specifically designed for UM students.

This repository began as a personal journey to understand academic concepts, particularly algorithms, which I found incredibly challenging. To better grasp WIA2004 Algorithm Design and Analysis, I started writing my own notes using Obsidian as my markdown editor. As finals approached, these notes became my lifeline, helping me answer past exam questions. When my friends asked for my answers, I realized that using Google Docs was inefficient—it required an internet connection, had a slow startup, and a distracting interface. So, I turned to GitHub for backup, a decision that felt like finding a reliable friend in the vastness of the internet.

Over time, I noticed that other students were reading my notes. This simple act made me realize that many CS students at UM struggle due to a lack of study materials—answers to past exams, tutorials, and timely access to lecture notes. Online resources like YouTube videos and GeeksforGeeks can be overwhelming and not always helpful. Some even feel like they waste your precious time.

In that moment of clarity, I decided to create a repository to store all CS-related materials. As a Software Engineering student, my focus is on writing notes and answers for SE-related courses. This project is not just about sharing knowledge; it’s about building a community, a support system for those who, like me, have felt lost at times.

Currently, this repository lacks a lot of information. However, I am committed to expanding it, making it as helpful and useful as possible. This isn’t just a study resource; it’s a reflection of my journey through university life.

As I approach graduation from UM, I hope to carry with me knowledge that I can apply in my career and that stays with me throughout my life. I want to look back and see how far I’ve come, how much I’ve learned, and know that I’ve made a difference for others.

This repository contains backups of my Obsidian notes and all local `.md` notes for studying Computer Science.

Currently, I have written notes and answers for the following subjects:

1. WIA2005 Algorithm Design and Analysis
2. WIA2004 Operating Systems
3. MIT Missing Semester

These are my personal notes, written in a style that might not be formal, with potential factual inaccuracies and language errors. If you find a note unsuitable, feel free to skip it and find one that suits you better.

If you would like to contribute to improving the repository, please submit a Pull Request.

The repository is not fully organized yet, but I plan to fix it eventually. This is more than a project; it’s a labor of love, a testament to my growth, and a gift to all who tread this path after me.
