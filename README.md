# Notes

This repository contains backups of my Obsidian and all local `.md` notes for studying Computer Science. 

Currently, I have written notes and answers for the following subjects:

1. WIA2005 Algorithm Design and Analysis
2. WIA2004 Operating Systems
3. MIT Missing Semester

These are my personal notes, so the writing style might not be formal, and there might be factual inaccuracies. Additionally, the language might contain errors. If you find a note unsuitable, feel free to skip it and find one that suits you better.

If you would like to contribute to improving the repository, please submit a Pull Request.

The repository is not fully organized yet, but I plan to fix it eventually.
